Introduction
------------
`covis` is an R package containing plotting functions for the visualisation of
coverage depth across cancer gene panels.

Datasets
--------
The following datasets are required:

1. BED file from [mosdepth](https://github.com/brentp/mosdepth) with per base
   depth of coverage 
2. BED file from UCSC containing exon/transcript coordinates
3. Text file from GENCODE mapping transcript IDs to HGNC gene names
4. GTF file from GENCODE containing details about gene transcripts
